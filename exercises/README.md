## Exercise 18: Count Word Frequencies - Hard 🥵 (Est. Time: 20-30 mins | Points: 40)

**Problem:** Given a string of text where words are separated by spaces, print all the words that appear in the text and their frequencies as shown in the output data.

### Input:
- A string of text with words separated by spaces.

### Output:
- A list of tuples where each tuple contains a word and its frequency, sorted by the words.

### Examples:

| No. | Inputs                             | Outputs                                                   |
| --- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | one two three one four five seven ten seven one | ('one', 3) ('four', 1) ('seven', 2) ('ten', 1) ('three', 1) ('two', 1) ('five', 1) |
| 2   | apple orange apple banana          | ('apple', 2) ('banana', 1) ('orange', 1)                  |
| 3   | hello world hello python           | ('hello', 2) ('python', 1) ('world', 1)                   |
| 4   | cat dog cat bird                   | ('bird', 1) ('cat', 2) ('dog', 1)                         |

### Note:
This exercise tests the ability to count word frequencies and sort words in Python.
